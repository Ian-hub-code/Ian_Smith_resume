	<h2>A bit about myself</h2>
	
	<p> <img src = "image1.jpg" style="width: 11vw; min-width: 40px; position: absolute; right: 55%; top: 8%" />
	I matriculated from Brackenfell Highschool in 2012, then I completed <br>
	my National Diploma full time at CPUT and went on to finish my Bachelor's <br>
	of Technology part-time in Surveying.<br>
	<br>
    I'm active and like to stay fit, I played cricket and rugby for Brackenfell High School's first teams.<br> 
	I enjoy gaming with friends and i like to learn and understand new programming concepts.<br>
	<br>
    I always wanted to study programming and now I have finally decided to fully commit to it,<br>
	 I'm hoping to land a software engineering role at a respected company to excell my career! </p>
